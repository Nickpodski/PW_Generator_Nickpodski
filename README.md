# PW_Generator_Nickpodski

## Description

  This is a random password generator that I created for a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp. When you click the generate button it prompts you to choose a password length, and then will ask you 4 questions for password criteria. The criteria is if you'd want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Then it displays the randomly generated password for you to use.
